The script includes the following steps:

Importing necessary libraries: The script imports necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, tensorflow, transformers, and sklearn.
Loading the pre-trained DistilBERT model and tokenizer: The script loads the pre-trained DistilBERT model and tokenizer from Hugging Face's transformers library.

Testing the tokenizer: The script tests the tokenizer with a few sentences without any preprocessing. The tokenizer returns a dictionary with two keys: 'input_ids' and 'attention_mask'. The 'input_ids' contain the token ids with padding symbol as 0 by default, and 'attention_mask' contains the mask of the attention in int format.
